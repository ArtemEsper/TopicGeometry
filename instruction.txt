 We want to implement solution from this repo (https://github.com/justdataplease/bigquery-lemmatization) to get
 lemmatization in the bigquery

 Here's a step-by-step guide to implementing the BigQuery lemmatization using Google Cloud Functions and the repository you mentioned (bigquery-lemmatization).

Prerequisites
Google Cloud Project: Ensure you have a Google Cloud project set up.
Google Cloud SDK: Make sure you have the Google Cloud SDK installed on your local machine.
BigQuery and Cloud Functions APIs Enabled: Enable the BigQuery and Cloud Functions APIs in the Google Cloud Console.
Step 1: Clone the Repository
Start by cloning the repository to your local machine:

bash
Копировать код
git clone https://github.com/justdataplease/bigquery-lemmatization.git
cd bigquery-lemmatization
Step 2: Review the Python Script
The repository contains a main.py file which is the Cloud Function script that performs lemmatization on a BigQuery dataset using the nltk library. Review this file to understand the lemmatization logic and make any necessary changes to suit your specific dataset.

If you need to customize the lemmatization (e.g., handle domain-specific vocabulary), edit main.py.

Step 3: Set Up a Virtual Environment and Install Dependencies
To make sure that all dependencies work correctly, set up a Python virtual environment and install the necessary packages:

bash
Копировать код
python3 -m venv env
source env/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
Step 4: Prepare Your BigQuery Dataset
Ensure you have a BigQuery table that you want to lemmatize. For example, if you have a table named my_dataset.my_table with a text_column containing text data, that’s what you’ll use in the function.

Step 5: Set Up a Cloud Storage Bucket (if not already created)
You’ll need a Cloud Storage bucket to store temporary data and logs generated by the Cloud Function.

bash
Копировать код
gsutil mb gs://your-bucket-name
Replace your-bucket-name with a unique name for your bucket.

Step 6: Deploy the Cloud Function
Deploy the Cloud Function using the following command. This will upload the code from the repository to Google Cloud Functions:

bash
Копировать код
gcloud functions deploy bigqueryLemmatization \
  --runtime python39 \
  --trigger-http \
  --allow-unauthenticated \
  --entry-point main \
  --set-env-vars BUCKET_NAME=your-bucket-name \
  --timeout=540s
Replace your-bucket-name with the name of your Cloud Storage bucket.

Here’s a breakdown of the parameters:

--runtime python39: Specifies Python 3.9 as the runtime.
--trigger-http: Sets up the function to be triggered by HTTP requests.
--allow-unauthenticated: Allows unauthenticated access to the function. For private access, omit this.
--entry-point main: Specifies the entry point of the function (matches main.py).
--set-env-vars: Passes the BUCKET_NAME environment variable to specify the Cloud Storage bucket for temporary data.
--timeout=540s: Increases the timeout to 540 seconds (the max allowed), which is helpful for large datasets.
Step 7: Trigger the Cloud Function
Once deployed, trigger the function by making an HTTP request to the URL provided by Google Cloud.

For example, you can use curl to trigger the function and specify parameters like the dataset and table:

bash
Копировать код
curl -X POST <function_url> -H "Content-Type:application/json" -d '{
    "project_id": "your-project-id",
    "dataset_id": "my_dataset",
    "table_id": "my_table",
    "text_column": "text_column_name"
}'
Replace <function_url> with the URL of your deployed function, your-project-id with your Google Cloud Project ID, my_dataset with the name of your dataset, my_table with the name of your table, and text_column_name with the name of the column containing the text to lemmatize.

Step 8: Check the BigQuery Table
After the function completes, check your BigQuery table for the lemmatized output. The function might create a new table with the lemmatized data.

Step 9: Monitor Logs and Results
Cloud Functions Logs: Go to Cloud Functions > Logs in the Google Cloud Console to monitor the execution of your function.
Cloud Storage Bucket: Check your Cloud Storage bucket if the function has created any intermediate files or logs.
Optional Step: Schedule the Function (if needed)
If you need to run the lemmatization process periodically, set up a Cloud Scheduler job to trigger the function on a schedule.

Step 10: Clean Up Resources
After running the function, consider cleaning up resources to avoid unnecessary charges:

Delete the Cloud Function if it’s no longer needed:

bash
Копировать код
gcloud functions delete bigqueryLemmatization
Delete any temporary files from your Cloud Storage bucket.
